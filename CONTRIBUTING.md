## Development Workflow

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`
2. Make your changes
3. Run `pytest` to verify all tests pass

## Code Style

- Full type hints on all public functions
- Use Pydantic models for data structures
- Scrapers must extend `AbstractScraper`
- Functions under 50 lines; files under 800 lines
- Follow PEP 8

## Adding a New Scraper

1. Create a new worker file in the project root
2. Extend `AbstractScraper` with `fetch_events()` method
3. Register in `main.py` scraper list
4. Add tests for dedup, normalization, edge cases
